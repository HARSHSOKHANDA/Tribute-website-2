          <h2>Indian socialist revolutionary</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Singh was born to Vidyavati Kaur</b> and Sardar Kishan Singh, in
            a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 at Lyallpur in Punjab
            Province of British India. His family had earlier been involved in
            revolutionary activities against the British government. His uncle,
            Swaran Singh, had participated in the freedom struggle against the
            British. When in 1907, an another uncle of Bhagat, Ajit Singh was
            arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma, Swaran asked the people of
            Punjab to force the government to release him and due to his efforts
            Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon Jail in October 1907. After
            coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt
            against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to
            start a movement against them. The movement called
            <em>'Pagdi Sambhal Jatta' was launched in 1908.</em>
